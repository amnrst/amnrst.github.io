Back in 1920, there were a couple of banks in Cleveland,
where one bank was short of its reserve requirement for a day,
because more customers in that Bank showed up to withdraw cash, than they anticipated.

They got together with another Bank across the street,
which had excess reserves and they decided to clear one banks deficiency,
by exchanging checks, nothing more than checks.

The cash lenders check was drawn on its reserve account, which was cleared immediately.
While the cash borrowers check, was drawn on its house account, which cleared the next day.

What was born, was the federal funds market where,
its purpose was to transfer cash back and forth,
between reserve-deficient participants and reserve-surplus participants.

That was a way for the banking system to manage its liquidity profile,
as it related to statutory reserve requirements,
and it was nothing more than a handshake,
because it was essentially between two participants,
who knew each other, and they often knew each other well.

This federal funds market and the idea of wholesale money,
practically disappeared in the 1930s and 1940s,
because of the Great Depression and the collapse in banking.

But it made a roaring comeback in the 1950s,
and when it came back in the 1950s it had changed, and transformed a bit.

It was no longer strictly about banks trying to manage their reserve requirement.
It became a mechanism for all sorts of financial players to begin funding positions,
and it became a true funding market, but there was a problem because it was still a handshake market.

It was still you lend overnight on an unsecured basis to
somebody you knew, but as the market grew, expanded and included all
different players, there became a desire for some way to add
security, because other than reputation alone why else would you lend in an
unsecured basis.

That was the impetus behind what became the repo market.
Basically it's the same structure as an unsecured
interbank transaction where instead of a handshake,
you're putting up security for the cash
that you're borrowing.

Banks are financial counter-parties in an interbank market, where
one party puts up a financial security in return for borrowing
cash. That gives the cash lender a degree of security,
to not necessarily worry about the reputation of whoever is borrowing their
cash, so long as they had some security.

  "03:15    let's start with just",
  "03:18    the basics oh the basic interbank market",
  "03:20    wholesale market you know I think most",
  "03:24    people are probably familiar with",
  "03:25    something called federal funds if for",
  "03:27    nothing for no other reason than the",
  "03:28    Federal Reserve that has been its main",
  "03:30    lever of monetary policy control at",
  "03:32    least controlling expectations for",
  "03:34    decades so people are somewhat familiar",
  "03:36    with the idea of a federal funds an",
  "03:38    unsecured lending market I may not know",
  "03:41    where it came from back in 1920 you know",
  "03:44    this is whether this is an apocryphal",
  "03:46    story or not there was a couple banks I",
  "03:47    believe in Cleveland going off the top",
  "03:49    of my head where one bank was short of",
  "03:51    its reserve requirement for a day",
  "03:53    because you know customers in that Bank",
  "03:55    just you know more customers showed up",
  "03:57    to withdraw cash than they anticipated",
  "03:58    just through a regular course of",
  "04:00    business and they got together with",
  "04:01    another Bank on the other side of town",
  "04:02    or even across the street I think is the",
  "04:04    story I heard and they decided you know",
  "04:06    the bank across the street had excess",
  "04:08    reserves and they decided the way that",
  "04:09    they would clear the one banks",
  "04:11    deficiency was by exchanging checks",
  "04:13    nothing more than checks the cash",
  "04:16    lenders are check was drawn on its",
  "04:17    reserve account which was cleared",
  "04:19    immediately while the cash borrowers",
  "04:21    check was drawn upon its house account",
  "04:23    was cleared in the next day so what was",
  "04:25    born was the federal funds market where",
  "04:27    its",
  "04:28    purpose was to transfer cash back and",
  "04:30    forth between deficient reserve",
  "04:33    deficients of participants and reserve",
  "04:35    surplus participants and that was a",
  "04:38    wholesale way for the banking system to",
  "04:40    manage its liquidity profile as it",
  "04:42    related to statutory reserve",
  "04:44    requirements and it was nothing more",
  "04:46    than a handshake because again and this",
  "04:47    is this initial primitive wholesale",
  "04:50    market it was essentially between two",
  "04:52    participants who knew each other and",
  "04:53    they knew it often knew each other well",
  "04:55    well this whole federal funds market and",
  "04:58    the idea of wholesale money kind of took",
  "05:02    a step back in fact it it practically",
  "05:04    disappeared in the 1930s in the nineteen",
  "05:06    forties because of the Great Depression",
  "05:07    the collapse in banking but made a",
  "05:09    roaring comeback in the 1950s but when",
  "05:12    it came back in the 1950s it had changed",
  "05:14    and it transformed a bit it was no",
  "05:16    longer strictly about banks trying to",
  "05:18    manage their reserve requirement Reserve",
  "05:19    profile it became a mechanism for all",
  "05:22    sorts of financial players to begin",
  "05:24    funding positions and so it became a",
  "05:26    true funding market but there was a",
  "05:28    problem because initially it was still a",
  "05:30    handshake market it was still you lend",
  "05:32    overnight on an unsecured basis to",
  "05:34    somebody you knew but as the market was",
  "05:36    growing and expanding including all",
  "05:39    these different players there became you",
  "05:41    know a desire for some way to add",
  "05:43    security because other than reputation",
  "05:46    alone why else would you lend in an",
  "05:47    unsecured basis and so that was the",
  "05:49    impetus behind what became well the repo",
  "05:52    market actually existed but what turned",
  "05:54    the repo market into another wholesale",
  "05:56    market that today actually far exceeds",
  "05:58    anything that takes place out there we",
  "06:02    won't have a lot of time to get into the",
  "06:03    why it's called a repurchase agreement",
  "06:05    or repo market but basically it's the",
  "06:07    same structure as an unsecured unsecured",
  "06:10    interbank transaction it's a wholesale",
  "06:12    market where instead of a handshake",
  "06:14    you're putting up security for the cash",
  "06:17    that you're borrowing and from another",
  "06:19    bank and so these are financial",
  "06:20    counterparties an interbank market where",
  "06:22    one party puts up a financial security",
  "06:25    in return for lending cash for borrowing",
  "06:29    cash excuse me it's that that gave the",
  "06:31    cash lender a degree of security that",
  "06:34    they wouldn't have to necessarily worry",
  "06:35    about the reputation or not knowing the",
  "06:38    reputation of whoever is borrowing their",
  "06:40    cash so long as they had some security",
  "06:42    it was a reasonable it was a reasonable",
  "06:45    way to conduct business across a what",
  "06:47    became a very large dynamic global",
  "06:51    marketplace however when you're when",
  "06:56    you're when you're a cash lender in the",
  "06:58    repo market and you're putting up you're",
  "07:00    getting security and return financial",
  "07:02    securities in return for lending cash",
  "07:04    that creates some other factors that you",
  "07:07    have to consider primarily the biggest",
  "07:09    one is the security itself because",
  "07:11    there's all sorts of different financial",
  "07:12    securities that can be put up for to you",
  "07:15    in to secure the cash that that's that's",
  "07:17    being lent in primarily the the most",
  "07:20    pristine form of collateral the one",
  "07:22    that's best that's most widely accepted",
  "07:24    on the most reasonable terms are US",
  "07:26    Treasury bonds US Treasury notes and",
  "07:28    actually US Treasury bills the reason is",
  "07:31    because there's basically no credit risk",
  "07:32    I know people will argue with that point",
  "07:35    and say that the government is",
  "07:36    especially lately is doing everything",
  "07:38    you possibly can to create credit risk",
  "07:41    by you know borrowing as much as it",
  "07:44    possibly can but as far as the market is",
  "07:46    concerned these these large governments",
  "07:48    are Treasury bonds and Treasury notes",
  "07:50    and especially Treasury bills are",
  "07:52    essentially free of credit risk and so",
  "07:55    they're the most pristine form of",
  "07:58    collateral however but because of the",
  "08:01    way the market is structured and because",
  "08:02    of what you're actually doing you're",
  "08:04    accepting a financial security in return",
  "08:06    for cash you have to be aware of the",
  "08:09    liquidity characteristics of the",
  "08:11    collateral you're accepting in fact this",
  "08:13    is the the biggest factor this is the",
  "08:16    you know the primarily the thing that",
  "08:18    drives the repo market more than",
  "08:20    anything is the liquidity",
  "08:21    characteristics of the collateral that's",
  "08:23    being accepted and so at least is",
  "08:25    something called a haircut what a",
  "08:28    haircut is is as a cash lender you have",
  "08:31    to be aware of the security you're",
  "08:33    getting in terms a case that the in case",
  "08:36    that when you lend cash to the borrower",
  "08:38    the borrower doesn't return your cash",
  "08:41    they default on the default on the",
  "08:43    interbank loan even if it's an overnight",
  "08:44    thing what you have to do in that",
  "08:46    situation to be made whole is you have",
  "08:48    to sell the collateral that's been",
  "08:50    posted to you and if you have to sell",
  "08:52    the collateral it's been posted you",
  "08:53    tomorrow that you're glad you're given",
  "08:56    today",
  "08:56    you have to sell it tomorrow because the",
  "08:57    cash isn't returned to you you have to",
  "08:59    protect yourself a little bit in case",
  "09:02    the value of that collateral moves",
  "09:03    overnight so when the when the market",
  "09:06    opens in the morning the cash borrower",
  "09:07    says I'm defaulting on the loan and you",
  "09:09    got to dump the clatter on the market",
  "09:11    you better hope that there's a market",
  "09:13    there that you're able to liquidate the",
  "09:14    collateral that you've received",
  "09:16    otherwise you're going to lose out too",
  "09:18    so the haircut is the way that the cash",
  "09:20    lender protects itself from the movement",
  "09:23    and value of the securities that are",
  "09:24    being posted to us so for something",
  "09:26    that's a pristine form of collateral",
  "09:27    like US Treasury bonds bills or notes",
  "09:29    the haircuts not going to be very large",
  "09:31    because we don't expect that the market",
  "09:33    for Treasuries is going to move too much",
  "09:34    on a day to day basis again that's all",
  "09:37    that we care about is is the cash lender",
  "09:39    in the repo market we don't really care",
  "09:41    about the credit profile we only care",
  "09:42    about the market tomorrow",
  "09:44    is there going to be a predictable",
  "09:45    liquid and efficient market the next day",
  "09:48    so if I have to dump the collateral",
  "09:50    because the the cash borrower is",
  "09:51    defaulted I can do so and cover",
  "09:54    everything that everything that I need",
  "09:55    to cover so I don't lose any money so",
  "09:57    we've been on a 2% haircut what that",
  "10:00    says it's a it's basically a bit of over",
  "10:02    collateralization what that means is we",
  "10:05    ask for a little bit of extra collateral",
  "10:07    in case you know market moves tomorrow",
  "10:09    price of Treasuries Falls we don't",
  "10:11    expect them to fall much but they might",
  "10:12    fall a little bit so if you add a 2%",
  "10:14    haircut the cash borrow has to put up",
  "10:16    say you know in our example I'm showing",
  "10:18    you here five hundred and ten dollars to",
  "10:21    get five hundred dollars in cash and so",
  "10:22    if the Treasury is dropped by two",
  "10:24    percent tomorrow I'm still covered",
  "10:25    because I've got enough over",
  "10:27    collateralization that I can be me hold",
  "10:29    in the event of default that's what a",
  "10:31    haircut it is and again I have to stress",
  "10:33    this point and I overstated as much as I",
  "10:36    possibly can that liquidity",
  "10:38    characteristics are what matter in the",
  "10:40    repo market so Jeff now there are a",
  "10:44    quick question here I'm guessing the",
  "10:47    haircut is different oh you just",
  "10:49    answered it I was gonna say the the",
  "10:50    rates can't be kind of a fixed thing",
  "10:53    right because we're talking about the",
  "10:54    overnight market in general here the the",
  "10:56    duration of this loan is is a day or so",
  "11:00    right in most cases with these repos",
  "11:03    that's right and you're exactly right",
  "11:05    and I think you know exactly where we're",
  "11:07    going with this because the care cuts",
  "11:09    are going to be different for every",
  "11:10    asset class because again what we care",
  "11:12    about is the liquidity profile of the",
  "11:14    collateral that's being posted so for my",
  "11:16    example here if you're trying to post",
  "11:18    instead of US Treasury some form of",
  "11:20    corporate junk bond or even just a",
  "11:21    corporate bond of even investment grade",
  "11:23    the haircuts going to be a little bit",
  "11:25    higher it's gonna be adjusted based on",
  "11:27    the perceived liquidity profile of the",
  "11:28    collateral that's being added so for you",
  "11:30    know my hypothetical stylized example",
  "11:32    here if you're trying to use junk",
  "11:34    corporates instead of US Treasuries",
  "11:36    let's say the haircuts seven percent",
  "11:38    that means you have to come up with a",
  "11:39    lot more over a collateralization to get",
  "11:41    to to get the the repo transaction to",
  "11:44    take place and again that's because the",
  "11:46    cash lender wants to be completely",
  "11:47    protected in the event of a default a",
  "11:49    corporate junk market those those values",
  "11:52    could could move around quite a bit even",
  "11:54    in an overnight session so that's why",
  "11:57    the haircut will be adjusted so much",
  "11:58    higher because you're protecting",
  "11:59    yourself for what what would the market",
  "12:01    look like tomorrow if I have a default",
  "12:04    and I have to dump the collateral on",
  "12:05    them I have to liquidate the collateral",
  "12:06    to get my cash back so the haircuts",
  "12:09    going to be a reflection upon the",
  "12:10    liquidity characteristics which are also",
  "12:12    taking taken to consideration credit",
  "12:14    characteristics but mostly the liquidity",
  "12:16    characteristics of the collateral that's",
  "12:18    being posted so let's go through a",
  "12:22    realistic example here and again it's a",
  "12:25    stylized example but you know it isn't",
  "12:27    just the repo market doesn't just take",
  "12:29    place where people just show up and post",
  "12:31    collateral and you know money flies back",
  "12:33    and forth there's actually there's a",
  "12:35    pretty sophisticated operation and a lot",
  "12:38    that goes in behind the scenes in terms",
  "12:40    of especially the collateral site I",
  "12:42    think people focus focus way too much on",
  "12:44    what's going on in the cash side when",
  "12:46    really the interesting stuff and really",
  "12:48    the the big dangers are mostly on the",
  "12:50    collateral and that sounds you know",
  "12:52    maybe that's a little bit",
  "12:53    counterintuitive because it seems like",
  "12:55    if you're posting security that's the",
  "12:57    end of the matter because I mean it's a",
  "12:59    securitizer",
  "12:59    or it's a secured loan therefore what do",
  "13:02    we care about the security itself what",
  "13:06    really happens is all sorts of other",
  "13:08    things behind the scenes and often the",
  "13:10    shadows where the collateral maybe isn't",
  "13:13    what it always seemed so let's start",
  "13:15    with the example of a hedge fund that's",
  "13:17    just a that wants to run a portfolio of",
  "13:19    US Treasuries so it has a portfolio of",
  "13:22    just enough US Treasuries that",
  "13:23    balance out with a haircut but it",
  "13:26    doesn't usually go into the repo market",
  "13:27    itself because it's probably not set up",
  "13:29    to do so so what it will do is it will",
  "13:31    contract with a dealer bank who does",
  "13:33    operate in the repo market and it will",
  "13:36    pledge it's five hundred ten dollars and",
  "13:37    20 cents in US Treasuries to the dealer",
  "13:39    bank now what the dealer bank will do is",
  "13:42    custody those Treasuries and perform all",
  "13:44    sorts of custodial operations on behalf",
  "13:46    of the hedge fund but by and large",
  "13:48    oftentimes what happens is the dealer",
  "13:50    bank will offer also offer a better rate",
  "13:53    for funding these this portfolio of",
  "13:55    securities because if the hedge fund",
  "13:58    allows the dealer bank to repledge those",
  "14:00    same securities into the repo market so",
  "14:03    that's what ends up happening a lot of",
  "14:05    cases so you'll have hedge funds running",
  "14:07    portfolios of securities that are",
  "14:09    pledged to a bank who then reap ledges",
  "14:11    the securities whatever they are in our",
  "14:14    case US Treasuries to the repo market to",
  "14:17    secure the cash that the other bank will",
  "14:19    then lend to the hedge fund so already",
  "14:21    we've got a note we've already removed",
  "14:22    the ultimate owner of the securities and",
  "14:25    the collateral one step away from the",
  "14:27    marketplace and in fact this repledge is",
  "14:31    a massive piece of the puzzle just going",
  "14:34    by and I'm showing you here the last ten",
  "14:36    Q or 10k from Morgan Stanley just one of",
  "14:39    the dealer banks and they tell you that",
  "14:41    they had you know more than half a",
  "14:42    trillion half a trillion from one bank",
  "14:44    of Reap ledged collateral that was that",
  "14:47    was used in the repo market that's the",
  "14:48    point of this it's I think it's",
  "14:51    astounding and I think it blows a lot of",
  "14:52    people's minds because again as I said",
  "14:54    you know repo sounds really",
  "14:57    straightforward it all it is is a",
  "14:58    collateralized overnight into your bank",
  "14:59    loan and so there's collateral and",
  "15:01    there's cash and what else is there once",
  "15:03    you find out is that there all these",
  "15:05    different things that are going on where",
  "15:07    the collateral isn't necessarily what it",
  "15:09    seems you know by the way it takes place",
  "15:11    to these massive amounts and huge",
  "15:13    degrees when you talk about one bank and",
  "15:15    half a trillion of collateral being reap",
  "15:17    ledged on behalf of other parties you",
  "15:19    start to get the sense that you know",
  "15:21    maybe there's a lot of stuff going on",
  "15:23    that we maybe we need to pay attention",
  "15:24    about a lot of potential a lot of",
  "15:28    possible failure points and bottlenecks",
  "15:31    that can form and so as these these",
  "15:33    Treasuries are pledged from the hedge",
  "15:36    front to the dealer bank they're now",
  "15:37    possession the dealer Bank who reap",
  "15:39    ledges them into the marketplace we also",
  "15:42    have the possibility of something called",
  "15:44    rehypothecation now this is kind of a",
  "15:46    controversial subject so I'm not going",
  "15:48    to spend too much time on it all over hi",
  "15:50    provocation is is something like double",
  "15:52    dipping so the dealer Bank is using",
  "15:54    those pledged Treasuries on behalf of",
  "15:57    the hedge fund to borrow funds from the",
  "15:59    repo market to fund the hedge funds",
  "16:00    positions what rehypothecation says is",
  "16:04    that they'll also use those treasures to",
  "16:05    fund some of their own activities and so",
  "16:07    they're sort of like recreating or",
  "16:10    creating additional Treasuries out of",
  "16:12    thin air now again it's a controversial",
  "16:15    subject some people claim it doesn't",
  "16:16    happen I tend to believe it happens more",
  "16:18    than people want to think and it was a",
  "16:20    big problem back in 2008 and 2009 but",
  "16:23    again it you know my point being here",
  "16:25    that the collateral side of the system",
  "16:27    has all of these different ways for",
  "16:29    these kinds of things to go on and what",
  "16:31    we're really getting at here is that the",
  "16:33    stock of collateral that's used in the",
  "16:35    repo market is a very complex process",
  "16:38    that the opens the door to all sorts of",
  "16:40    you know functions like multiplication",
  "16:42    so collateral can be expanded the list",
  "16:44    can be expanded this quantity can be",
  "16:46    expanded and it's all based upon these",
  "16:48    financial considerations of the cash",
  "16:49    lender dealer Bank and the ultimate",
  "16:51    users and then it gets even weirder from",
  "16:54    here we're just we're just getting",
  "16:56    warmed up here well let me say let me",
  "16:58    jump in here Jeff just a couple things",
  "17:02    one of the questions it's being asked is",
  "17:05    theoretically this process is leveraging",
  "17:08    collateral right so this seems like a",
  "17:10    derivative of a derivative you know I",
  "17:11    think you put up Morgan Stanley which",
  "17:13    would take the role of the dealer bank",
  "17:15    in this case right Morgan Stanley is",
  "17:17    very large and that's why there's that",
  "17:19    half a trillion plus of reap ledged",
  "17:22    collateral but it sounds like this this",
  "17:27    collateral is kind of being compounded",
  "17:29    in a way and I think you mentioned that",
  "17:31    there may be a you know is it being",
  "17:33    multiplied I mean is this a huge space",
  "17:36    is there a huge space given the the re",
  "17:40    collateralization if there's such a word",
  "17:43    that that would be a huge failure point",
  "17:46    in this system oh yeah absolutely and I",
  "17:49    think that's exactly the right way to",
  "17:50    put it",
  "17:51    multiple multiplier with collateral and",
  "17:54    it sounds weird and it sounds strange",
  "17:56    and whoever asked the question is",
  "17:57    exactly right it sounds like a",
  "17:58    derivative of a derivative and that's",
  "18:00    exactly we're talking about where we",
  "18:02    have collateral that acts like its own",
  "18:03    currency system it's it's own fractional",
  "18:06    multiply for if for lack of a better",
  "18:07    term and then you know it's weirder from",
  "18:11    here",
  "18:11    we've only got we've only scratched the",
  "18:12    surface with with pledging and rhe",
  "18:14    pledging and it's a it's part of the the",
  "18:17    fabric of the modern repo market where",
  "18:19    this is just accepted you know and again",
  "18:22    I didn't want to get into the history",
  "18:23    behind why it's called a repurchase",
  "18:25    agreement but we went through decades",
  "18:27    where it wasn't really we weren't really",
  "18:28    sure who owned the assets that were",
  "18:30    being pledged and realized and it took",
  "18:32    it took many Supreme Court cases to",
  "18:34    finally settle on a standardized repo",
  "18:36    contract where it says you know in our",
  "18:38    example the hedge fund is the ultimate",
  "18:40    owner of the securities even when",
  "18:42    they've been pledged to the dealer Bank",
  "18:43    and the dealer Bank is plug them into",
  "18:44    the repo market which allow this process",
  "18:47    to go sorry isn't this boy this sounds a",
  "18:52    whole lot like those are MBS and those",
  "18:56    kinds of things where these subprime",
  "18:59    loans are being packaged and in sold to",
  "19:01    the sovereign fund Norway and then",
  "19:04    people default on their Alexei Mike it's",
  "19:08    just another way to kind of take",
  "19:11    something and repackage it and make",
  "19:12    money off of it and repackage it again",
  "19:15    and reap you know it's got that sense to",
  "19:19    it or am I kind of missing the point",
  "19:20    here no not at all you've got the point",
  "19:23    exactly in fact the hold that's the",
  "19:24    whole point behind securitization in the",
  "19:26    first place was to create a repo level",
  "19:28    security because we're really talking",
  "19:29    about is funding leveraged what is the",
  "19:31    cheapest form of funding one of the",
  "19:33    things that probably should have gone",
  "19:34    over back at the beginning from look",
  "19:36    from the cash borrower side the reason",
  "19:39    you want to do and on a secured loan",
  "19:40    rather than an unsecured loan is that a",
  "19:42    secured loan is a cheaper loan because",
  "19:45    if you're putting up securities anybody",
  "19:46    knows who borrows using collateral",
  "19:48    you're gonna be giving a better rate",
  "19:50    because it's perceived to be much safer",
  "19:52    from the perspective of the cash lender",
  "19:54    so if you're doing overnight repo it is",
  "19:56    the absolute cheapest form of funding",
  "19:58    imaginable and so if you're getting it",
  "20:00    to you know RMBS and subprime mortgages",
  "20:02    even prime mortgages back during the",
  "20:03    housing bubble era",
  "20:05    that's exactly what was going on",
  "20:06    everybody wanted the maximum amount of",
  "20:08    leverage possible which meant you had to",
  "20:10    create securities in a liquid market for",
  "20:13    those securities so that way they would",
  "20:14    become acceptable repo collateral and",
  "20:17    that's exactly what happened and so our",
  "20:19    example here is sort of a modern update",
  "20:21    of what actually happened in 2007 and",
  "20:24    2008 which was a breakdown in the repo",
  "20:26    collateral side of the repo market and",
  "20:28    unfortunately not a lot was learned from",
  "20:32    episode in a lot of ways we have the",
  "20:35    same faults we have the same potential",
  "20:37    failure points except we're no longer",
  "20:39    talking about you know subprime",
  "20:40    mortgages now we're talking about",
  "20:42    corporates and junk corporate bonds it's",
  "20:44    really kind of the same process because",
  "20:46    you know nobody really you know",
  "20:48    everybody thought 2007-2008 the great",
  "20:50    financial crisis was about subprime",
  "20:53    mortgages when in real life excuse me",
  "20:55    when in reality it was a breakdown of",
  "20:57    the repo market so Jeff when somebody",
  "21:00    defaults on this on this on this",
  "21:03    short-term loan and it went through a",
  "21:06    dealer Bank and him may have gotten",
  "21:08    repackaged one or two or three times",
  "21:10    who's really on the hook here who gets",
  "21:13    hung is it the hedge fund / the supreme",
  "21:17    court case that you had discussed or how",
  "21:20    does that work well it's it it's a it",
  "21:24    all depends on the collateral because",
  "21:26    you know it sounds weird and it sounds",
  "21:29    unnatural to put it frankly but there",
  "21:32    are repo repo defaults that are",
  "21:35    absolutely regular I mean we're talking",
  "21:37    about hundreds of billions of reap where",
  "21:39    to call repo fails that take place every",
  "21:40    week every week it's a natural part of",
  "21:44    the market where the collateral in the",
  "21:45    cash get all mixed up and screwed up so",
  "21:47    that a fail happens when the fail",
  "21:49    happens is simply the cash lender",
  "21:51    doesn't get its cash back or the cash",
  "21:53    borrow or doesn't get its securities",
  "21:55    back and that's it's become a regular",
  "21:57    part of the marketplace and what happens",
  "21:59    is when there's periods of a high degree",
  "22:02    of stress in the repo system larger than",
  "22:04    the collateral side you'll see the level",
  "22:06    of repo fails spike in September and",
  "22:09    October 2008 for example the level of",
  "22:12    repo fails got up into five trillion",
  "22:14    which meant that the collateral system",
  "22:16    is effectively just shut down",
  "22:18    which is one reason why we had such a",
  "22:20    massive worldwide panic because there",
  "22:21    was no collateral available to fund all",
  "22:24    of these risk positions well we'll get",
  "22:26    to that in a minute because we're gonna",
  "22:27    recreate that kind of the process using",
  "22:30    our examples here but your points and it",
  "22:33    really is it's you know we're we're",
  "22:35    still looking at basically the same",
  "22:38    types of failure points in the same ways",
  "22:39    in which the system can fail the same",
  "22:42    potential for bottlenecks very cool okay",
  "22:47    yeah go ahead there are a lot of",
  "22:49    questions I don't even know where to",
  "22:50    start with this because I mean all the",
  "22:52    questions that's being asked okay let's",
  "22:54    look at this haircut okay I need 500",
  "22:57    bucks I need to borrow 500 bucks so I",
  "22:58    pledge either you know junk paper or US",
  "23:05    government paper when I borrow that 500",
  "23:09    bucks for one day let's say just the",
  "23:12    bridge a gap because I have customers",
  "23:14    coming into the bank taking cash out",
  "23:16    when you when this deal is done and now",
  "23:20    I can give you your five hundred dollars",
  "23:22    back do you keep that haircut or do you",
  "23:24    keep a portion of it uh or no you know",
  "23:28    is that a secure there's a haircut there",
  "23:30    for security as you said to cover the",
  "23:32    fluctuation of the paper that I'm",
  "23:34    putting up for collateral but there's a",
  "23:36    fee underlying it and therefore you know",
  "23:38    you need to do trillions of dollars of",
  "23:40    this to really make it a profitable",
  "23:42    venture for a dealer Bank or how does",
  "23:43    that work yeah there's there's like",
  "23:46    three or four questions first I think",
  "23:48    let's let's be clear this modern",
  "23:51    wholesale marketplace no longer has",
  "23:53    anything or really much to do with about",
  "23:54    required reserves that was just the way",
  "23:56    it all got started",
  "23:57    so these modern wholesale markets are",
  "23:59    actually funding mechanisms for",
  "24:01    financial players to fund their",
  "24:03    portfolio positions so in our case it's",
  "24:04    you it's a hedge fund and so what",
  "24:07    happens is because it's an overnight",
  "24:08    transaction what you do is you roll over",
  "24:11    that transaction every day so day after",
  "24:13    day after day after day so we go through",
  "24:14    this dance where tomorrow we unwind our",
  "24:17    transaction and then redo it all over",
  "24:19    again and so you know in some ways it's",
  "24:21    ridiculous but it gives the cash lender",
  "24:24    of the ability to say no I don't want to",
  "24:25    do this anymore and it gives the",
  "24:26    borrower to say you know enough but the",
  "24:29    point about over collateralization is",
  "24:31    really in the case where",
  "24:32    or the the cash borrower defaults on the",
  "24:36    cash and the cash lender wants to be",
  "24:38    completely protected against any loss",
  "24:40    because you're whoever ask the question",
  "24:42    is exactly right the spreads here are",
  "24:44    not massive they're not huge and so",
  "24:46    that's why you see Morgan Stanley you're",
  "24:48    half a trillion and repledge collateral",
  "24:49    because on the cash side because Morgan",
  "24:52    Stanley's also lending cash into the",
  "24:54    repo market they have to do a large",
  "24:56    volume of transactions to make it",
  "24:58    economical and so there are a lot of",
  "25:00    these considerations again we're trying",
  "25:02    to do a very simplistic model so you can",
  "25:04    understand the way that the collateral",
  "25:06    system works in terms of its",
  "25:09    relationship the whole thing okay one",
  "25:13    more of while we're here who has access",
  "25:16    to this market it's any kind of",
  "25:20    sophisticated financial player that runs",
  "25:21    a repo desk so I mean any of the big",
  "25:23    dealer banks some of the hedge funds do",
  "25:26    their own repos we'll get into on our",
  "25:28    own I mean insurance companies money",
  "25:29    market funds money market funds are a",
  "25:31    big cash lender in the repo market in",
  "25:33    fact the probably the largest cash",
  "25:35    lender there's all sorts of these you",
  "25:37    know shadow bank players that that are",
  "25:41    really responsible for how the repo",
  "25:44    market operates and so you know what",
  "25:46    we're going to go through here is just",
  "25:48    again it's a very simple model because",
  "25:50    we're trying to tease out some of these",
  "25:51    these concepts these basic concepts that",
  "25:54    take place in their actual repo market",
  "25:56    and it's it's much more complex than",
  "25:58    making out to be okay so if we go on to",
  "26:03    you know where we left off we had a",
  "26:05    hedge fund that was pledging Treasury",
  "26:07    securities what if we have a hedge fund",
  "26:10    that only has their wants to invest in",
  "26:12    only junk corpus because you know reach",
  "26:14    for yield they want to increase their",
  "26:15    returns but you know they don't want to",
  "26:18    put up the $537 in what would it would",
  "26:21    take for haircuts to go into the repo",
  "26:23    market themselves they can essentially",
  "26:26    contact the dealer bank to transform",
  "26:28    their collateral they're posting into",
  "26:30    the best best possible collateral which",
  "26:33    is US Treasuries so in this situation a",
  "26:36    dealer bank will contract with probably",
  "26:39    an insurance company or a pension fund",
  "26:41    any of the you know the financial",
  "26:43    counterparties out there that have a",
  "26:44    large static pool",
  "26:46    securities that they're not otherwise",
  "26:47    using typically an insurance company and",
  "26:49    they will borrow in this case the",
  "26:51    insurance company will lend us",
  "26:53    Treasuries to the dealer bank who will",
  "26:55    then transform the hedge funds",
  "26:57    collateral so that the Treasuries are",
  "26:59    ended up what getting reap ledged into",
  "27:02    the repo market so from the perspective",
  "27:04    of the repo market it's accepting US",
  "27:07    Treasuries as collateral when in fact",
  "27:08    the basis for the trade is the junk",
  "27:10    bonds held by the hedge fund so the",
  "27:13    dealer bank is transforming junk",
  "27:15    collateral into pristine collateral for",
  "27:17    a fee and it's going to be charged a fee",
  "27:19    and some of that fee will be paid to the",
  "27:20    insurance company for the privilege of",
  "27:22    lending these securities but again you",
  "27:25    can see that what we're getting at here",
  "27:26    is there are all of these different ways",
  "27:28    for the collateral side of the repo",
  "27:30    market to not be what it's so simple and",
  "27:32    easy to understand and again that's",
  "27:35    another way that we can get into trouble",
  "27:36    with all of these possible failure",
  "27:39    points and so a more realistic example",
  "27:42    of the market might be a hedge fund that",
  "27:45    runs repo itself so let's let's first",
  "27:49    simplicity sake let's say half of its",
  "27:51    junk bond positions are repo directly",
  "27:53    into the repo market and the other half",
  "27:55    are transformed into the US Treasury",
  "27:58    collateral using the dealer Bank and",
  "28:00    collateral transformation under",
  "28:01    securities lending business and so let's",
  "28:05    let's let's go back a couple weeks back",
  "28:07    into early march when we started to see",
  "28:09    credit spreads rise again remember what",
  "28:10    I said at the beginning all the repo",
  "28:13    market the cash lender cares about is",
  "28:15    the liquidity characteristics of the",
  "28:18    securities being posted to them as",
  "28:20    collateral for the overnight interbank",
  "28:22    loan so if there's any question about",
  "28:25    the market for junk bonds or even US",
  "28:27    Treasuries as we'll see in a minute the",
  "28:29    haircuts are going to be adjusted so if",
  "28:32    we get into a situation where you know",
  "28:34    corporate bond even not even just junk",
  "28:36    bonds but investment grade corporate",
  "28:37    bonds are selling off pretty violently",
  "28:39    the the repo market the cash lenders",
  "28:42    might decide if they need a bigger",
  "28:43    haircut on the junk bonds that are being",
  "28:46    posted so you're a hedge fund you've got",
  "28:48    your five hundred and thirty seven",
  "28:49    dollars in junk you you you do the repo",
  "28:52    today and then tomorrow when you go to",
  "28:54    roll over the overnight repo loan the",
  "28:57    cash lender and the other side says I'm",
  "28:59    not",
  "28:59    for a 7% haircut I now want 12% the",
  "29:03    reason I want 12% is because the market",
  "29:04    has moved a lot it's in some place this",
  "29:07    is becoming illiquid so I need to be",
  "29:09    really assured that I can sell your junk",
  "29:12    bonds onto the market in case you happen",
  "29:13    to default no by the way the fact that",
  "29:15    you're holding a lot of junk bonds in",
  "29:17    your portfolio makes me even more",
  "29:18    nervous that you are going to default so",
  "29:21    as the haircuts are adjusted it's the",
  "29:23    same thing as a margin call but in the",
  "29:25    case in this case is a collateral call",
  "29:26    so on half of its portfolio the hedge",
  "29:30    fund now has to put up another 30 some",
  "29:32    dollars in collateral just to do the",
  "29:35    same $500 trade it did the day before",
  "29:37    Wow and if if the if the hedge fund",
  "29:41    doesn't have that collateral what does",
  "29:43    it do well it might go through the the",
  "29:45    other channel which is through the",
  "29:47    transformation which means it'll",
  "29:49    increase the amount of it depends upon",
  "29:51    the dealer Bank for collateral",
  "29:52    transformation which also depends upon",
  "29:55    the insurance company being willing to",
  "29:57    lend US Treasuries to the dealer bank",
  "29:59    and usually in that situation what",
  "30:02    happens is the haircuts applied in the",
  "30:05    transformation to because the dealer",
  "30:06    bank isn't stupid either and it",
  "30:08    understands the risks of what's going on",
  "30:09    in the corporate junk and junk our",
  "30:11    market so you have haircuts adjusted on",
  "30:14    the collateral transformation in",
  "30:16    securities lending side to hedge fund",
  "30:19    that's been owning all of these",
  "30:20    corporate bonds and again it wasn't even",
  "30:22    just junk bonds but actual you know back",
  "30:24    in 2007 and 2008 it wasn't just the",
  "30:27    subprime mortgage bonds that got the",
  "30:29    haircuts adjusted it was even the the",
  "30:32    most the best-quality prime mortgage",
  "30:34    bonds they got severe haircut",
  "30:36    adjustments - and the reason was because",
  "30:38    again to stress the point before the",
  "30:41    cash lenders don't care about the credit",
  "30:43    quality of the bonds they only care",
  "30:45    about the liquidity characteristics in",
  "30:47    2007 or 2008 look the market for",
  "30:50    mortgage bonds of all types just dried",
  "30:52    up and so you'd see even prime mortgage",
  "30:54    bonds go bid less uncertain on certain",
  "30:56    days and therefore if you're a cash",
  "30:58    lender and all you care about is the",
  "30:59    ability to sell the collateral tomorrow",
  "31:01    you don't want to you don't want to do",
  "31:03    that transaction you don't want to do",
  "31:04    the repo transaction because you're not",
  "31:06    even sure you can sell the thing",
  "31:07    tomorrow so not only do you have to have",
  "31:09    haircuts adjusted in some cases the",
  "31:12    collateral",
  "31:12    comes non-negotiable on any terms which",
  "31:15    which did happen in 2007-2008 and there",
  "31:18    are anecdotes that happen again last",
  "31:20    month in the corporate market where a",
  "31:21    lot of places went bid less but if",
  "31:24    you're in the position of the hedge fund",
  "31:25    where your repoing yourself and you're",
  "31:28    going through collateral you know",
  "31:29    securities lending and transformation",
  "31:30    all this weird wonderful stuff what do",
  "31:33    you do is it where is your recourse what",
  "31:36    do you do if you're getting a collateral",
  "31:37    call because the haircuts are being",
  "31:38    adjusted all over the place well you",
  "31:40    really don't have any you can try to buy",
  "31:42    some US Treasuries from the market or an",
  "31:45    in lieu of being able to secure more in",
  "31:48    additional collateral that you can post",
  "31:49    you're going to have to just start",
  "31:51    selling assets at whatever price you can",
  "31:54    so that's what we end up with that's",
  "31:57    what we saw a bulk back in 2007 and 2008",
  "31:59    as well as what happened over those few",
  "32:02    weeks and starting in late late February",
  "32:05    of 2020 and it got to the point where it",
  "32:09    was so bad liquidity wise and the cash",
  "32:11    lenders became so picky about their",
  "32:13    collateral there was even bifurcation in",
  "32:15    the Treasury market itself where the the",
  "32:18    the market itself which began to to",
  "32:21    choose and began to offer the most",
  "32:24    reasonable repo terms only to those who",
  "32:27    had on the run Treasury securities and",
  "32:29    the difference between on the running",
  "32:30    off the run on the runners OTR off the",
  "32:33    runners ofr on the runner are Treasury",
  "32:36    securities that are the most liquid",
  "32:37    there's a stuff that's just been",
  "32:38    auctioned off there's that's where the",
  "32:40    market really takes place in Treasury",
  "32:42    buying and selling",
  "32:43    where as off the runner things like",
  "32:44    notes and bonds of old vintages that",
  "32:46    don't really trade all that much and so",
  "32:48    it got so bad and in March of 2020 that",
  "32:52    the market began to break down even in",
  "32:55    even where people were trying to use US",
  "32:57    Treasuries it's as collateral usually in",
  "33:02    terms of trying to meet these collateral",
  "33:04    calls from this breakdown in the",
  "33:06    collateral side of the system and that's",
  "33:08    how bad it had gotten and so you know",
  "33:10    again if you're the hedge fund where you",
  "33:12    know you can't go into the repo market",
  "33:14    directly because the haircuts become too",
  "33:16    big you can't go to the securities",
  "33:18    lending because you're also going to get",
  "33:19    a big haircut so no by the way the",
  "33:21    collateral that's offered through the",
  "33:22    transformation channel some of that's",
  "33:25    not even going to be used",
  "33:26    in the repo market either so the point",
  "33:29    I'm trying to make here is that there",
  "33:30    are all of these potential failure",
  "33:32    points in terms of just how it works on",
  "33:34    the collateral side of things very",
  "33:37    interesting I can't keep up with a",
  "33:42    number of questions that are being asked",
  "33:44    Jeff I seems like we we need to like",
  "33:47    almost turn this into a miniseries but",
  "33:50    you are actually hitting many of them as",
  "33:52    you're going along and and I'll let you",
  "33:56    I think it's best to let you finish up",
  "33:58    in case in case you do answer a question",
  "34:02    with something that is that you're gonna",
  "34:04    cover anyway I hate the jump ahead so",
  "34:06    why don't we get through the rest of",
  "34:08    what you want it to cover and then we'll",
  "34:10    go through the questions all in one shot",
  "34:12    yeah that probably makes a lot of sense",
  "34:14    that way you couldn't just handle the",
  "34:15    questions and I'll try to be brief about",
  "34:17    the rest of the presentation here you",
  "34:19    know the slides that I'm showing you",
  "34:20    here",
  "34:22    my point is showing that this is that",
  "34:23    this this collateral transformation this",
  "34:26    rehypothecation repledge all the stuff",
  "34:28    is not strictly a domestic issue in fact",
  "34:30    this repo market in u.s. dollars this",
  "34:33    interbank wholesale funding mechanism",
  "34:35    actually is a global marketplace and",
  "34:37    most of it takes place outside the US",
  "34:39    u.s. boundary so you have this you have",
  "34:41    all these global financial participants",
  "34:43    whether they're global banks global",
  "34:45    governments local foreign overseas banks",
  "34:47    all of these people that are that are",
  "34:49    transacting in this this wholesale",
  "34:51    marketplace to fund these various",
  "34:53    positions and financial goals and",
  "34:55    financial aims and it expands all over",
  "34:57    the place and it creates not just you",
  "34:59    know havoc potential havoc in the",
  "35:01    domestic system but for what is really a",
  "35:04    global dollar system it's not just that",
  "35:06    you know the US dollar as a reserve",
  "35:07    currency is a global currency and",
  "35:10    therefore if repo is the primary",
  "35:12    mechanism for liquidity in that monetary",
  "35:14    system you would expect that the all of",
  "35:16    these things that take place in the",
  "35:18    domestic market actually take place",
  "35:19    outside of it and just to briefly go",
  "35:21    over this this this example here we have",
  "35:24    leave government of Argentina which",
  "35:26    Argentina needs US dollars because again",
  "35:28    the US dollars a global reserve currency",
  "35:30    but Argentina is not a great credit on",
  "35:32    the US dollar markets even in you know",
  "35:34    2016 and 2017 when the euro bond market",
  "35:37    was exploding for all sorts of",
  "35:40    what would really be junk sovereign debt",
  "35:42    denominated in u.s. dollars it was",
  "35:44    better to try to do this this repo",
  "35:46    collateral transformation and so what in",
  "35:48    this hypothetical example the governor",
  "35:50    of Argentina intends to raise US dollars",
  "35:53    so it goes to a local Argentinian bank",
  "35:55    and says we want you to raise US dollars",
  "35:57    on their behalf by floating a euro baht",
  "35:59    in the government the Argentinian Bank",
  "36:01    which I denote as Bank a will use those",
  "36:03    real euro bonds in the euro bond is",
  "36:06    simply an offshore US dollar denominated",
  "36:08    debt so the Argentine Bank a uses the",
  "36:12    euro bond as collateral to transform it",
  "36:15    with global dealer Bank B which is the",
  "36:17    same as the hedge fund examples we used",
  "36:18    before where the dealer Bank contacts",
  "36:20    with the insurance company to borrow US",
  "36:23    Treasuries so that argentine bank a can",
  "36:26    then have US Treasuries to pledge in the",
  "36:29    in the in the global US dollar repo",
  "36:31    market so from the perspective of the",
  "36:33    repo market all it sees is that there's",
  "36:35    US Treasuries being pledged when in fact",
  "36:36    there are these very risky argentine",
  "36:39    eurobonds that are below the surface or",
  "36:41    behind the scenes and the shadows that",
  "36:43    are infecting and multiplying the",
  "36:45    collateral part of the system globally",
  "36:47    so again my point here is you know again",
  "36:50    complicated esoteric and also worldwide",
  "36:55    so as these things broke down in march",
  "36:58    what we asau was a very clear collateral",
  "37:02    bottleneck it was in many ways very much",
  "37:06    like 2007 and 2008 as you pointed out",
  "37:09    more in the in terms of subprime",
  "37:10    mortgages being used as collateral as I",
  "37:12    wrote back at the time the pattern",
  "37:14    repeat it every morning these repo",
  "37:17    transactions are unwound and what",
  "37:19    happened was these cash borrowers were",
  "37:21    posting collateral found that they",
  "37:23    couldn't post their collateral on the",
  "37:25    same terms they did yesterday haircuts",
  "37:27    were being adjusted they were being hit",
  "37:29    with all these kinds of collateral calls",
  "37:31    and what that did was that that forced",
  "37:33    these these players who were trying to",
  "37:35    fund their positions in repo markets",
  "37:37    through indirect means they had to find",
  "37:39    some kind of alternate which again was",
  "37:41    usually Treasury bills because all of",
  "37:43    those are on the run therefore the most",
  "37:45    liquid trend most liquid collateral so",
  "37:47    every morning as the repo yesterday's",
  "37:49    repo transactions were on being unwound",
  "37:51    collateral calls were happening you'd",
  "37:53    see the markets",
  "37:54    hi everybody just pile into Treasury",
  "37:56    bills and those who are unable to secure",
  "37:59    Treasury bills they had to fire sale",
  "38:01    their assets and so that's what happened",
  "38:03    over was a six days this the six worst",
  "38:07    days in the US stock market or back in",
  "38:09    February March as I've shown you here",
  "38:11    you saw the same thing every day you've",
  "38:15    got everybody piling into Treasury bills",
  "38:17    which was the collateral call or the",
  "38:19    tell-tale sign and indirect sign the",
  "38:21    collateral call and liquidations across",
  "38:23    all of these markets including stocks",
  "38:25    the reason is because as people are",
  "38:28    trying to fund their positions in the",
  "38:30    repo market they're not just funding you",
  "38:32    know corporate bonds of US Treasuries as",
  "38:34    I was showing you in a very simple",
  "38:35    stylized example they're funding all",
  "38:37    sorts of risky positions and risky",
  "38:39    portfolios so as these collateral calls",
  "38:42    because the repo market starts to unwind",
  "38:44    in the collateral side of the repo",
  "38:45    market on lines they hit they turn eight",
  "38:48    they may force leverage players to begin",
  "38:50    liquidating anything and everything they",
  "38:53    can which is why there's such a direct",
  "38:55    link between what happened in t-bills",
  "38:56    therefore collateral and an asset fire",
  "38:59    sales across all sorts of risky markets",
  "39:01    including stocks and it even got to be a",
  "39:05    point you were so bad as I as I pointed",
  "39:07    out before where the Treasury market",
  "39:09    itself became bifurcated as to what was",
  "39:11    acceptable collateral that even the",
  "39:13    people in the Federal Reserve the",
  "39:15    Federal Open Market Committee minutes",
  "39:16    make mentions of how there was a problem",
  "39:19    in the Treasury market in terms of this",
  "39:21    distinction on the run and office Iran",
  "39:23    and if the Federal Reserve figures out",
  "39:25    that there's a problem in this distinct",
  "39:27    it with this distinction you know it",
  "39:29    must have been bad because they're",
  "39:30    always the last people to figure this",
  "39:32    stuff out hmm Wow so what we're getting",
  "39:35    at here is a very complicated esoteric",
  "39:38    system that very few people know about",
  "39:40    very few people take much take much",
  "39:43    pretty much attention to but it's a",
  "39:46    vital and crucial part of way the global",
  "39:49    financial again Global global US dollar",
  "39:51    financial system works and how",
  "39:53    everything is interconnected and runs",
  "39:55    through not just a cash light or repo",
  "39:57    but more importantly all of these things",
  "39:59    on the collateral side really really",
  "40:03    fascinating it opened up the whole a",
  "40:05    whole new thing I have this question",
  "40:08    you know convergent members all get this",
  "40:10    live live news feed and what I hear",
  "40:17    every morning is the announcer saying",
  "40:19    something like I'll tell you what he",
  "40:21    said this morning at 7:31 here in",
  "40:24    Chicago 831 Eastern says New York Fed",
  "40:28    accepts 23.5 of twenty three point five",
  "40:31    billion bids at overnight repo operation",
  "40:34    so that's one announcement that I hear",
  "40:37    constantly and some of that some of",
  "40:38    these numbers get pretty big like 80",
  "40:40    billion and so on and then shortly",
  "40:42    thereafter a guy comes back on he says",
  "40:45    New York Fed accepts all 11 point 1",
  "40:48    billion in overnight repo bids backed by",
  "40:51    Treasuries at a stop out rate of 0.1",
  "40:54    percent that sounds almost like a flight",
  "41:00    pattern codes or something",
  "41:03    you know can you can you describe what's",
  "41:06    happening here why I've noticed that",
  "41:09    whatever is being bid whatever amount",
  "41:14    dollar amounts being bid it seems to be",
  "41:17    100 percent accepted by the Fed",
  "41:21    currently what what is that all about",
  "41:23    well these repo operations aren't",
  "41:26    actually repo operations they're just",
  "41:28    called repo operations because the Fed",
  "41:30    is mimicking a repo transaction with the",
  "41:32    primary dealers so that's that's number",
  "41:34    one number two what it's doing is has",
  "41:36    nothing to do with what the Fed is doing",
  "41:38    has nothing to do with the collateral",
  "41:40    side of things which is why these repro",
  "41:42    operations ended up not doing what any",
  "41:44    good in fact during the worst parts of",
  "41:46    the crisis you saw zero bids for the",
  "41:47    feds repo operations because nobody had",
  "41:49    any collateral to post so what the Fed",
  "41:52    is trying to do is be what the Fed is",
  "41:53    you know the Fed is you have to",
  "41:55    understand way behind the monetary curve",
  "41:57    they have a 1950s view of the monetary",
  "41:59    system and so they're viewing you know",
  "42:02    the fire sale liquidations across all",
  "42:03    these markets as a cash shortage rather",
  "42:06    than a collateral shortage and so these",
  "42:08    repo operations intend to open up a",
  "42:12    conduit for primary dealers specifically",
  "42:15    to be able to bid for bank reserves",
  "42:18    which are a form of cash used in the",
  "42:20    system but if we don't really have a",
  "42:22    of cash and his hens we instead have a",
  "42:24    shortage of collateral what good are",
  "42:27    these repo operations in fact that's why",
  "42:29    no matter how much the Fed offered in",
  "42:32    repo operations it didn't really have",
  "42:34    much of an impact you still had all",
  "42:36    these fire sales across risky assets",
  "42:37    because it doesn't actually go toward",
  "42:40    the real problem which is on the",
  "42:41    collateral side rather than the cash",
  "42:43    side okay I want to run through the",
  "42:47    questions that are being asked here and",
  "42:49    if you feel like the answer to any one",
  "42:51    of these is is another hour-long",
  "42:54    discussion then we can we can just punt",
  "42:57    on that move on to the next because",
  "42:59    there's quiet there are quite a few here",
  "43:00    so I'm gonna go with the most recent",
  "43:02    first the first question I have Jeff",
  "43:08    says that a dollar shortage would hit",
  "43:10    the system in the first moment but for",
  "43:13    what we have seen in gold prices it",
  "43:15    seems that this had already passed what",
  "43:17    are his thoughts about it what are we",
  "43:22    talking about here the the dollar",
  "43:25    shortage and the collateral sure it's",
  "43:26    yeah I think there's also other things",
  "43:29    to consider including what our calendar",
  "43:32    bottlenecks which everybody knows about",
  "43:34    quarter and window dressing but there's",
  "43:36    particular quarter end periods where it",
  "43:38    gets worse than other periods and they",
  "43:40    happen to be the middle of March in the",
  "43:41    middle of September there's the reason",
  "43:43    why Bear Sterns fails in the middle of",
  "43:45    March 2008 Lehman Brothers and AIG",
  "43:47    failed in the middle of September 2008",
  "43:49    and what we should saw the you know",
  "43:52    global financial crisis number to hit in",
  "43:54    the middle of March 2020 and the reason",
  "43:57    is the dealers offer their least amount",
  "43:58    of liquidity in the least amount of",
  "44:00    balance sheet capacity to do these kind",
  "44:02    of things like collateral transformation",
  "44:03    and securities lending around those",
  "44:06    kinds of bottlenecks so what I think",
  "44:07    happened what I saw up until the middle",
  "44:10    of March was that created a heightened",
  "44:12    pressure and what was already a bad",
  "44:14    situation but once the system got past",
  "44:16    that collateral that that calendar",
  "44:18    seasonal low point things started to",
  "44:21    loosen up so that's why you've seen gold",
  "44:23    be able to skyrocket because gold is",
  "44:24    also a one of the things that leveraged",
  "44:28    participants in the repo market turned",
  "44:29    to is sort of a collateral of last",
  "44:31    resort and that depresses the price of",
  "44:34    gold as it's being used which is why",
  "44:36    our everyday you saw those fire sale",
  "44:38    liquidations gold would go down as TV",
  "44:41    bill prices went up and fire and assets",
  "44:43    were fire sales everywhere so I think",
  "44:45    we've gotten past the max point of",
  "44:46    maximum pressure which was in the middle",
  "44:48    of March okay",
  "44:52    can you help me understand the",
  "44:54    distinction between the global dollars",
  "44:55    Shores but there isn't an actual",
  "44:57    shortage and liquidity which is why the",
  "44:59    feds money printing is ineffective I",
  "45:01    mean there's a statement of opinion in",
  "45:03    that question if you disagree with that",
  "45:05    opinion you can just start with that",
  "45:07    no it's it's people think the Fed prints",
  "45:11    money when it doesn't this you know the",
  "45:14    the monetary system this whole say a way",
  "45:16    of doing things and in fact the fact",
  "45:18    that it goes throughout the rest of the",
  "45:20    globe the monetary system evolved",
  "45:23    without the Federal Reserve behind it",
  "45:24    the Federal Reserve is nothing more than",
  "45:25    a domestic bank Authority yet everybody",
  "45:27    thinks it's think of it as a central",
  "45:29    bank in fact that's what the Federal",
  "45:30    Reserve wants you to believe if you",
  "45:32    think the Fed is printing money that's",
  "45:34    what they want you to think because they",
  "45:35    think you'll then act in an inflationary",
  "45:36    manner but the Fed doesn't actually",
  "45:39    print money just like it doesn't",
  "45:40    actually do repo operations it has the",
  "45:43    thin veneer of money printing when all",
  "45:45    it does is create bank reserves which",
  "45:47    are modestly and that's probably being",
  "45:50    too charitable modestly useful for the",
  "45:52    banking system it's not actual money you",
  "45:54    can't walk into a grocery store with a",
  "45:55    bank reserve you can't possess a bank",
  "45:57    reserve so unless the banking system",
  "45:59    does something with those bank reserves",
  "46:01    it's not adding any liquidity to the",
  "46:03    system and if banks are the reason why",
  "46:05    we have a dollar shortage to begin with",
  "46:06    it doesn't matter how many bank reserves",
  "46:08    they possess the dollar shortage is the",
  "46:10    banks not the central bank and even if",
  "46:12    you did consider that to be money",
  "46:14    printing when you see the Fed expand its",
  "46:17    balance sheet or any central bank",
  "46:18    including the Bank of Japan or ECB or",
  "46:19    anybody when they're expanding their",
  "46:21    balance sheet it's because the monetary",
  "46:23    system itself is already in a massive",
  "46:26    deficit so even if we counted the feds",
  "46:28    bent a bank reserves and money printing",
  "46:29    as money printing they're already behind",
  "46:31    the curve because the deficit is already",
  "46:34    preceding that what the Fed is doing so",
  "46:36    even as the Fed expands its balance",
  "46:38    sheet it's only because of an existing",
  "46:40    deficit in the private system where the",
  "46:41    banks operate and I believe a large big",
  "46:44    part of that is the lack of collateral",
  "46:46    especially corporate corporate",
  "46:52    why don't we switch gears here for a",
  "46:54    little bit because there's just an",
  "46:56    overwhelming number of questions here I",
  "46:59    want to make sure we wrap up by asking",
  "47:02    you this question and that is given what",
  "47:06    has happened with Cove at 19 given the",
  "47:09    correction that has taken place where",
  "47:12    where do you feel we are in terms of",
  "47:15    equity prices the indices crude oil gold",
  "47:19    versus where we're headed I mean with",
  "47:21    the with the Fed having done what it's",
  "47:23    done",
  "47:23    offering up 2.2 trillion after the you",
  "47:27    know the the initial claims released",
  "47:30    last week to buy I think to buy",
  "47:32    commercial paper or something you know",
  "47:34    where are we headed here Jeff again yeah",
  "47:37    like I just said the more the Fed does",
  "47:39    the more you should be concerned because",
  "47:41    the Fed doesn't solve the problem it",
  "47:43    tells you how big it is so the more the",
  "47:45    Fed has to do the more you have to",
  "47:46    realize the that existing dollar",
  "47:48    shortage deficit must be massive so",
  "47:51    nothing really has changed other than",
  "47:53    that seasonal bar like I talked about we",
  "47:55    got past that but",
  "47:57    especially the collateral site of repo",
  "47:59    they remain and so there's a tremendous",
  "48:02    risk moving forward of a repeat or a",
  "48:05    second wave of what would be global",
  "48:07    financial crisis number two in fact",
  "48:09    that's what we saw in 2008 it wasn't",
  "48:12    actually one banking crisis or dollar",
  "48:14    shortage there were two of them and in",
  "48:16    between them there was a period of calm",
  "48:18    very much like today where everybody",
  "48:19    thought well the Fed printed a bunch of",
  "48:21    money and everything's fine and",
  "48:22    everything's fixed between the time Bear",
  "48:24    Stearns failed in the summer of 2008 it",
  "48:27    really did look like things were moving",
  "48:28    in the right direction at least at least",
  "48:30    on the surface or outwardly when in fact",
  "48:33    when he looked underneath the rot was",
  "48:35    getting more rotten everything was going",
  "48:37    in the wrong direction and was kind of",
  "48:39    in the same position today where again",
  "48:41    nothing has changed since March except",
  "48:43    for the seasonal pressure so we're I",
  "48:45    think in the same position where you",
  "48:48    know the stock market is much more",
  "48:50    enthusiastic about the prospects of it",
  "48:52    being over where as you look at the bond",
  "48:54    market you're at all the futures other",
  "48:56    kinds of markets out there you sure's",
  "48:58    curve for example WTI they're all saying",
  "49:01    that no the risk of a second wave coming",
  "49:04    are really really high that's pretty",
  "49:10    scary so um so you get a phone call from",
  "49:15    our president or whomever puts people as",
  "49:19    their chairman of the Fed you're gonna",
  "49:21    call call to say hey Jeff love did this",
  "49:24    talk to you did with convergent awesome",
  "49:27    awesome presentation you're running the",
  "49:30    show now we need you to unwind this",
  "49:32    whole thing and fix the problem what",
  "49:34    does Jeff do I hang up the phone no it's",
  "49:48    look it's we're just we're only",
  "49:50    scratching the surface here we aren't",
  "49:52    even talking about the you know there",
  "49:54    are other problems well we're just",
  "49:55    talking about repo and collateral we",
  "49:57    haven't even we have any hit derivatives",
  "49:58    and FX and you know all of those kinds",
  "50:00    of things the real issue here is Bank",
  "50:03    capacity because that's what really",
  "50:04    liquidity that's where liquidity comes",
  "50:06    from that's where total quote money",
  "50:07    comes from modern money is all about",
  "50:09    what banks",
  "50:10    offer and if banks start willing to",
  "50:12    offer liquidity in any form whether it's",
  "50:14    repo collateral transformation cash and",
  "50:16    repo FX swaps all these kinds of things",
  "50:19    then you're screwed there's really not",
  "50:21    much you can do the Federal Reserve is",
  "50:23    itself powerless so step number one is",
  "50:26    we don't even know the full extent of",
  "50:29    this global dollar system largely",
  "50:31    because it's been left to the shadows",
  "50:33    for 50 years",
  "50:35    nobody monetary scholarship ended really",
  "50:37    in the 1970s and 1980s and for 20 years",
  "50:40    everybody thought well Alan Greenspan",
  "50:42    boosts the federal funds rate around a",
  "50:43    quarter point here and there that must",
  "50:45    be everything there is to know about",
  "50:47    money when in fact Alan Greenspan",
  "50:49    admitted throughout the 1990s the reason",
  "50:51    they did that was because back in the",
  "50:53    70s they could no longer define money at",
  "50:55    all",
  "50:56    so therefore if your central bank how do",
  "50:59    you operate monetary policy where you",
  "51:00    can't even define money well they came",
  "51:03    up with what was essentially a magic",
  "51:05    trick or as I call it a puppet show they",
  "51:07    moved the federal funds rate around and",
  "51:09    said well well signal to banks what we",
  "51:11    think they should be doing and we'll let",
  "51:12    the bank's sort out the details inside",
  "51:14    the monetary system well that ain't",
  "51:16    gonna work I mean 2007-2008 we get a",
  "51:19    breakdown in the repo market and there's",
  "51:21    nothing to fight can do about it that's",
  "51:23    why every every monetary program that",
  "51:25    they came up with in that time period",
  "51:26    none of it worked we had a global",
  "51:27    financial crisis now by the way it's a",
  "51:30    global financial crisis this is a global",
  "51:32    dollar system not a domestic dollar",
  "51:34    system so to get back to your question",
  "51:35    you know the first thing we got to do is",
  "51:37    we kind of catch yourself back up to",
  "51:40    where the monetary system was ten years",
  "51:41    ago",
  "51:42    let alone start to figure out where we",
  "51:44    can go from here we need more",
  "51:45    information what I'm trying to say we",
  "51:46    need to we need an actual exhaustive",
  "51:49    sample and study of the way the system",
  "51:51    actually works to go into the",
  "51:52    nitty-gritty details which I didn't do",
  "51:55    in this presentation behind all of this",
  "51:57    collateral transformation stuff all of",
  "51:58    this weird and exotic derivatives that",
  "52:00    take place that count as money in the",
  "52:02    modern monetary system only then when we",
  "52:04    have a handle on how this thing really",
  "52:06    is and how big it is can we start to",
  "52:08    figure out where the failure points are",
  "52:10    where there really are and what to do",
  "52:12    about them all right well I guess we'll",
  "52:16    have to have you back on go for that",
  "52:19    whenever that starts happening",
  "52:22    I'll cut it off here unfortunately",
  "52:25    I mean this there's been just a massive",
  "52:29    interest in what you're talking about",
  "52:31    and we just can't cover it all we've",
  "52:34    actually received not only what looks",
  "52:37    like a hundred different questions here",
  "52:39    we received several emails with",
  "52:41    additional questions relating to fed",
  "52:44    repo activity and the timing of it",
  "52:47    versus the movement of stock prices and",
  "52:49    so on and we once we parse through these",
  "52:52    questions we may just do a quick wrap it",
  "52:55    fire with you or something to see if you",
  "52:57    can answer some of these",
